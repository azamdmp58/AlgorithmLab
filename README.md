# Basic C Programs Collection

This repository contains a collection of beginner-friendly C programs that implement commonly used algorithms and logic-based operations. Each `.c` file has been compiled into an executable `.exe` file using a C compiler (like GCC).

## üóÇÔ∏è List of Programs

### Searching Algorithms
- `linearSearch.c` - Implements Linear Search algorithm.
- `binarySearch.c` - Implements Binary Search algorithm.

### Sorting Algorithms
- `bubbleSort.c` - Implements Bubble Sort algorithm.
- `quickSort.c` - Implements Quick Sort algorithm.

### Matrix Operations
- `matrixAddition.c` - Adds two matrices.
- `matrixSubtraction.c` - Subtracts one matrix from another.

### Number Utilities
- `biggestNumber.c` - Finds the largest number among a set of inputs.
- `smallestNumber.c` - Finds the smallest number among a set of inputs.
- `sumOfSubset.c` - Calculates the sum of a subset (could be subset sum logic or fixed array subset).

## üìÅ File Structure

Each program has:
- A `.c` source file with the implementation.
- A corresponding `.exe` compiled file for direct execution (on Windows).

## ‚úÖ How to Compile (if needed)

If you'd like to compile any `.c` file manually, you can use GCC:

```bash
gcc filename.c -o filename.exe
````

For example:

```bash
gcc bubbleSort.c -o bubbleSort.exe
```

## üîß Requirements

* GCC compiler (or any standard C compiler)
* Windows OS to run `.exe` files directly (or use Wine on Linux/macOS)

## üìö Purpose

This repository is meant for:

* Beginners learning C programming
* Practicing basic algorithms and logic building
* Creating a base for more advanced data structures and problem-solving

Created as part of a learning journey in C programming and Competitive Programming.
